# A/B Test: Font Style Impact on Readability and Engagement

### User Story Number
- **US4** (Golden Path)

### Metrics (HEART Framework)
1. **Happiness**: User satisfaction with overall readability.
2. **Engagement**: Average session time and page scroll depth.
3. **Adoption**: Increase in feature or page usage after readability improvement.
4. **Retention**: Returning users to previously visited sections of the app.

### Hypothesis
Switching to a new, cleaner font style will improve readability, making it easier for users to digest content quickly, which will lead to higher engagement and adoption rates.

### Problem Weâ€™re Solving
Current feedback suggests some users find the font slightly hard to read, particularly on mobile devices. This impacts user satisfaction and can contribute to users spending less time on content-heavy pages. Since readability directly influences user engagement and satisfaction, addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring users progress smoothly along the Golden Path.

### Experiment Setup
- **Audience**: Allocate 50% of the user base to the test group and 50% to the control group.
- **Tracking with Firebase Analytics**:
  - Measure session duration, page scroll depth, and returning user rates.
  - Track specific pages where font readability could impact user retention and progression along the Golden Path.
  - Set up satisfaction feedback prompts for a subset of users in each group to gather insights on font preference.

### Variations
1. **Control Group**: Current font style.
2. **Test Group**: New font style (e.g., sans-serif, optimized for readability).

### Mockups
Include mockups showing:
- Original font (Control Group)
- New font design (Test Group)

Each design should illustrate how key pages and components look under each variation, ensuring consistency and readability across devices.
